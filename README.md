# XHTML-Strict-valide-
TI 

view information associated with all authors (such as
their personal information, information from the books they wrote posted
in ascending order of their price)
• view the information associated with the books (such as the name (s) of the author (s),
the cover of the book which must turn into an image, etc.)
o The books must have a price in an interval passed in parameter (you
can use xsl: param).
o The data will be sorted in descending order of their author name (if
several we choose the 1st author).
These transform files must be written in XSLT and they will be used in
oXygen to generate the two files in valid XHTML-Strict format which will give
two different views on your data: one showing them by author and another by
delivered. I encourage you to use CSS to present the information.
